## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, include = FALSE)
```
```{r}
my.plot <- plot_ly(plotly::mic, r = ~r, t = ~t, color = ~nms, alpha = 0.5, type = "scatter")
layout(my.plot, title = "Mic Patterns", orientation = -90)
```
Here is my plot:
`r my.plot`
